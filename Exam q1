1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.

   public class Smartphone extend Technology{
      Number int = new Number n;}
      
   public Smartphone(string name, int number){
      this.name.Smartphone = name;
      this.number.Smartphone = number;}
      
b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.
   
   INHERITANCE is a process of a subclass take the method and the parameter of the superclass. In this case, the code writers
   don't need to create a new method or parameters just for the subclass which can save a lot of time. Furthermore, inheritance
   can overides a superclass method as well.

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
    
    public void speak(){
      System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + this.name.Samrtphone + " and my number is " + " + this.number.Smartphone);}
   
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
   
   It is called INHERITANCE.
